# Fretboard

## Synopsis

This program provides configurable drilling sessions for learning
the notes on the guitar fretboard.  Currently, the range of frets
is constrained to only the first twelve.  Also, only the standard
EADGBE tuning is supported by default but is easily changed in the
code.

## Examples

The following command invocation drills the user on only the first
two strings (E and B):

        fretboard -s 1:2

The following command invocation constrains drilling to strings
3 and 4 for only frets 7 through 12:

        fretboard -s 3:4 -f 7:12

## Usage
